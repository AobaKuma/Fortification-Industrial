        <description>A heavy artillery piece for indirect fire at extreme ranges. Due to the very high muzzle velocity of the weapon system, it has a large minimum range.\nCan fire nuclear warhead shells. Practice extreme caution when using these.\n\nThe 155 mm howitzer NK-30 “Empero” is a reliable artillery system developed by Interstellar Industries Complex Nara to provide support for pre-industrial worlds unable to withstand mechanoid invasions.</description>
